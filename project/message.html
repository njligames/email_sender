    <h1>Please let me introduce myself...</h1>
    <div>
	    <p>My name is James.</p>
	    <p>I am an educated, middle class Father, buried under student loans for the past 11 years.</p>
	    <p>
	    <ul>
		    <li>
			    I took out my first student loan in 1999 at 1.9% Annual Percentage Rate.
		    </li>
		    <li>
			    I finished my Associated Degree in 2001.
		    </li>
		    <li>
			    I finished my Bachelors Degree in 2005.
		    </li>
		    <li>
			    When I graduated, I had $55,000.00 in student loans with a 6% Annual Percentage Rate.
		    </li>
	    </ul>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    Making my minimum monthly payments of almost $500 for the past 11 years and having 2 periods of forbearance due to lay offsâ€¦ my student loans is nearly $60,000.00 with a 7.1% APR.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    In an attempt to take some of the money off,  I created an email campaign to ask people to help me pay off my student loan!
